# Evaluation of `Exactly-Once Semantics for Persistent Lock-Free Data Structures`

We implemented several queues and hashes based on memento, and evaluate their performance. To reproduce our results, please see the documentation for each data structrue. Also, for overall documentations, we assume you mount your PMEM at `/mnt/pmem0/`.
