/// A guard that keeps the current thread pinned.
///
/// # Pinning
///
/// The current thread is pinned by calling [`pin`], which returns a new guard:
///
/// ```
/// use crossbeam_epoch as epoch;
///
/// // It is often convenient to prefix a call to `pin` with a `&` in order to create a reference.
/// // This is not really necessary, but makes passing references to the guard a bit easier.
/// let guard = &epoch::pin();
/// ```
///
/// When a guard gets dropped, the current thread is automatically unpinned.
///
/// # Pointers on the stack
///
/// Having a guard allows us to create pointers on the stack to heap-allocated objects.
/// For example:
///
/// ```
/// use crossbeam_epoch::{self as epoch, Atomic};
/// use std::sync::atomic::Ordering::SeqCst;
///
/// // Create a heap-allocated number.
/// let a = Atomic::new(777);
///
/// // Pin the current thread.
/// let guard = &epoch::pin();
///
/// // Load the heap-allocated object and create pointer `p` on the stack.
/// let p = a.load(SeqCst, guard);
///
/// // Dereference the pointer and print the value:
/// if let Some(num) = unsafe { p.as_ref() } {
///     println!("The number is {}.", num);
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Multiple guards
///
/// Pinning is reentrant and it is perfectly legal to create multiple guards. In that case, the
/// thread will actually be pinned only when the first guard is created and unpinned when the last
/// one is dropped:
///
/// ```
/// use crossbeam_epoch as epoch;
///
/// let guard1 = epoch::pin();
/// let guard2 = epoch::pin();
/// assert!(epoch::is_pinned());
/// drop(guard1);
/// assert!(epoch::is_pinned());
/// drop(guard2);
/// assert!(!epoch::is_pinned());
