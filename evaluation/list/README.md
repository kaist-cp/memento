# Tracking

- time: Each experiment lasts 10 seconds and each data point is the average of 10 experiments
- key: chosen uniformly at random from the range [1, 500]. (Experiments for other ranges
can be found in [2]; they exhibit the same trends as the diagrams here.)
- number of initial items: 250 inserts of random keys, resulting in an almost 40%-full list.
- workload: update-intensive (30% finds) and read-intensive (70% finds) benchmarks.
- Results for other operation type distributions were similar
