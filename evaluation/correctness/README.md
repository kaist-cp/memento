# Detecability Evaluation (ยง6.1)

We evaluate the detectable recoverability of data structures based on Memento by killing an arbitrary thread and checking if the thread recovers correctly.

## Usage

You can test each data structure with the following command:

```bash
./build.sh # specially built for the thread crash test
./run.sh queue_general
```

where `queue_general` can be replaced with other supported tests (listed below).
This creates test log under `./out`.

## Expected output
