# Evaluation of "A General Framework for Detectable, Persistent, Lock-Free Data Structures" (ยง6)

We implemented several lock-free data structures based on memento, and evaluate their correcntess and performance. To reproduce our results, please see the documentation for each data structrue. We assume you mount your PMEM at `/mnt/pmem0/`.

- [Detecability evaluation](./correctness/README.md) (ยง6.1)
- Performance evaluation (ยง6.2)

  - [Detectable List](./list/README.md)
  - [Detectable Queue](./queue/README.md)
