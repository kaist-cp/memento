API
iterator API: iterate over available chunks and return descriptors

how do we pick the window over which we iterate

First approach: soft limits

grow_soft
shrink_soft

grow_hard 
shrink_hard

Second approach: iterator window 
 1. state iterator limits using logical addresses; the heap rounds up and iterates
 2. state iterator limits using window size; return the next N zones, or next N extents

PREFER THE SECOND APPROACH
