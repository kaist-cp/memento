/**
 * @defgroup CXX11 C++11 Keywords in Public Headers
 * @ingroup IDIOMS
 * @brief Defines macros for hiding C++11 features in public headers for clients that use C++98.
 * @details
 * @par C++11 in libalps
 * We basically \b do \b assume \b C++11 and our library provides the best flexibility when the
 * client program enables C++11. For example, the client program can simply contain alps-common
 * as a subfolder and statically link to it if C++11 is enabled.
 * However, some client program might have to stick to C++98. In that case, we provide our library
 * as an external shared library which comes with public headers that at least compile in C++98.
 * Thus, we will make sure C++11 keywords and classes do not directly appear in public header files.
 * The macros defined in this file are for that switching.
 *
 * @par DISABLE_CXX11_IN_PUBLIC_HEADERS macro
 * This macro is defined if __cplusplus < 201103L, meaning the compiler option for the programs
 * that include this header file (note: which is different from compiler option for libalps)
 * disables C++11.
 * If defined, our public headers must hide all C++11 dependent APIs.
 * So, there are several ifdefs on this macro in public headers.
 *
 * @par stdint.h vs cstdint
 * For the same reason, we include stdint.h rather than cstdint.
 * cstdint is a C++11 extension, which defines those integer types in std namespace
 * (eg std::int32_t). The integer types in global namespace are more concise to use, too.
 *
 * @par C++11 in cpp and non-public headers
 * Remember, this is only for public headers. We anyway compile our library with C++11.
 * We can freely use C++11 keywords/features in cpp and non-public header files, such as
 * xxx_impl.hpp, and xxx_pimpl.hpp. In other words, client programs must not include
 * them unless they turn on C++11. Also, impl/pimpl header files often include too much details
 * for client programs to rely on. They might change in next versions.
